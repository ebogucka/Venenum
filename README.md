# Venenum

Venenum is a very basic 2D roguelike game. It was originally created for a contest organised by [EXOR Studios](https://www.exorstudios.com/).

Control your character with WASD.

Combat is turn based (each turn you get 3 action points). You gain XP with each killed monster and levelling up happens automatically. When a new turn starts you regenerate a small amount of HP.

The goal is to find an antidote bottle hidden on the deepest level of the dungeon.
